			<p>the structural and textural characteristics of this erotic poem cycle derive from the 11 letters of the word <strong>sweethearts</strong><br />
			unluckily for the poet 3 of these 11 letters are <strong>e</strong>s and 2 others each occur twice&#160; so that there are only 7 different ones for word building&#160; from these letters are extracted all the words that make the poem the position of each letter on the page is determined by its place in the word <strong>sweethearts</strong><br />
			no single poem can be more than 11 letters wide or 11 letters deep<br />
			in addition to the word poems there are kinetic metaphors also constructed from the 11 letters of <strong>sweethearts</strong><br />
			these sections can be animated by flipping the pages fast enough to achieve a primitive cinematic effect<br />
			the words and the kinetic visual metaphors work hand in hand to express what the poem is all about<br />
			the author feels that this fusion is best achieved by beginning the book where in the west books traditionally end</p>
